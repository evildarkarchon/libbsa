# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use fine-grained, correctness-first phases derived from v1 requirements and research.
- [Roadmap]: Keep read/extract slices before writer slices so writer compatibility builds on proven parsing, hashes, compression, and DDS behavior.
- [Roadmap]: Keep TES5Edit read-only as a reference; all implementation belongs outside `TES5Edit/`.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BA2 DDS and Starfield writer behavior require fixture-backed validation before compatibility claims.
- Reference compatibility corpus still needs decisions about what can be committed versus kept external.
