# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create the spec or individual issue file at the path defined above, creating directories as needed. Never overwrite an existing ticket; allocate the next unused number within that feature.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path, including comments. Ticket numbers are scoped to a feature; use the feature and number together, or the full path. If a bare number matches multiple features, ask which one is intended. Explicit GitHub URLs and historical GitHub references still refer to GitHub; they are not local ticket numbers.

## Lifecycle

- New implementation issues start with `Status: needs-triage`. Use the canonical values in `triage-labels.md` for triage transitions.
- Complete a ticket by setting `Status: resolved` and appending the outcome under `## Comments`. Retain the file and its history. `resolved` is a completion state, separate from the five triage roles.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `open`/`claimed`/`resolved` for this wayfinding workflow.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
